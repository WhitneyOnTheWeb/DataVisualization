# Data Visualization
## P6: Make Effective Data Visualization

### Summary

This project is designed to fulfill the requirements for P6 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. The dataset chosen for this project was originally wrangled and cleaned for P4: Data Exploration in R. Dataset and analysis are located in the [DataExploration_R repository](https://github.com/WhitneyOnTheWeb/DataExploration_R). 

Th dataset contains information about and sales numbers for *VGChartz: Top 10,000 Best Selling Video Games Globally*. Expanding on the wrangled and cleaned dataset generated as part of an earlier project made sense, since it allowed me to work with an original dataset without expending a lot of extra time doing it again.
